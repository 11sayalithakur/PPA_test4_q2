Anagram
Given two strings, check if they’re anagrams or not. Two strings are
anagrams if they are written using the same exact letters, ignoring
space, punctuation and capitalization. Each letter should have the same
count in both strings.
For example, ‘Eleven plus two’ and ‘Twelve plus one’ are meaningful
anagrams of each other.
